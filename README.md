# Calculating and Verifying Abstract Machines

Agda code for my bachelor thesis, where based on the work of Bahr, Pickard, Hutton et al. a compiler for an abstract stack machine is derived from a specification of correctness.
The source language and compiler derivation are fully formalized within Agda.

---
Code was checked with Agda 2.6.3-9a5f2b4 and standard-library 1.6.
